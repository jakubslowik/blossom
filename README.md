# Blossom.css
### A modern CSS classless theme.

Blossom.css is modern looking minimal CSS theme. You can use it as a starting point for your website or as a way to quickly make unstyled site - a good looking one. It can serve as a base for a simple site or blog.

It is based on [Sakura.css](https://github.com/oxalorg/sakura), but tries to achieve more modern style.

It provides a set of opinionated rules, that are meant to make a text content and typography look well. It is also fully responsive.
